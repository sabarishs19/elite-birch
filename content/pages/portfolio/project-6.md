    content: "UX terms and analogies, and how to get started with User Experience & Structure.\n\nUser Experience - The way a user achieves something is called UX. To stay in perspective of the user and implement processes is called UX. The experience a user has whilst using the product is called User Experience.\n\nHuman-Computer Interaction - It is the study of the interaction between computers and humans.\r\nInteraction design explains the interactions between the user and the experience.\n\nThe visual subjects one sees are called the user interface. It talks about visual language. It is the feel of the product - simplified.\n\nUser Experience is mostly based on the user's emotions, behaviors, perceptions, and preferences. UX, it's more than just a process where most people think it's just Designing. UX is everywhere. It is a series of functionality, presence, livelihood, capabilities, and presentation.\n\nIt is a result of emotions and actions combined with the personality and the context of the user. Every step requires the implementation of UX because the user needs to feel comfortable and come back to it again. UX again is a combination of memory and empathy.\n\nWhen creating or designing a project, the focus must be on the end-user. The result should be the common experience of people. Any digital experience should be effective for the user. UX and UI, while they can be completely different themes, they produce the same result. Aspect results. While some projects can have simplicity and pleasantness, few projects can be aesthetic or complex based on the planned result. Design planning in UX is aimed to stimulate emotions and curiosity. Design planning can also have other practices, like how many steps should one follow to get to a certain point or the target modules that are going to be used. Design planning is the result of User Research, planning the experience, and analytical end outcomes.\n\n\n\nGestalt theories.\n"
