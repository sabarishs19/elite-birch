    content: "Google Ads - UX Case study\n\nGoogle ads haven't been perfect enough while embedded on a website. It clearly goes unnoticed hiding in plain sight. The primary purpose of this study is to create an experience that is better for both the user and the advertiser.\n\nResearch:\r\nThis problem statement is relatable and is common among advertisers who use google web page ads. Lower clicks with higher impressions certainly are bad while with the correct usage of theories it can be efficient.\n\nThe Discovery of ads can be difficult.\r\nHidden in plain sight (goes unnoticed)\r\nThe number of clicks is not in ratio with the number of impressions.\r\nSometimes the ad can be irrelevant and frustrating.\n\nTo understand the problem further, I surfed multiple websites of different niches and thus got additional clarity.\n\nInsights\n\n*   The ads stand out but seemingly implies likes it's forced.\n\n*   The ads are too minimalistic and go unnoticed.\n\n*   The highest clicks are generated when the ad is mostly relevant to the topic of interest.\n\n*   Page transition ads can be annoying and certainly, people don't want that.\n\n*   Inline ads are ignored the most.\n\nWhile the bounce rate for a website can be high, the click rate of an ad could be the exact opposite. Graphic designs can be done for it to strike out and gain an eye, but sometimes that even could be annoying for a few.\r\nIt should match with the experiences of all people who visit a website. Keep in mind that it shouldn't go camouflage nor have a bizarre look.\n\nUser Personas: Nothing really. Just two types of people. Frustrated and Chilled.\n\nThe solution should act as a suggestion for who could potentially try out the product/service mentioned in the ad. Either be it any platform, people should only see a genuine piece of advertising that doesn't take their eye from what they are there for.\n\nBad ads and their UX result in their ad being blocked.\r\nPop-up ads disrupt the flow of the user.\n\nThe ad in order to stand out must not be interfering but should be noticeable. It can look different than the surrounding elements, but should almost be in sync with the website content.\n"
