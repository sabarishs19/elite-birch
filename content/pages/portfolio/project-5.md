    content: "Google Ads - UX Case study\n\nWhile performing user research, it's important for the product to be commonly benefitting all types of users. While a product well-designed can be suitable for any type of user, ads can never be the same. There's a huge amount of dislike percentage for ads.\n\nGoogle ads haven't been perfect enough while embedded on a website. It clearly goes unnoticed hiding in plain sight. The primary purpose of this study is to create an experience that is better for both the user and the advertiser.\n\nAds, in a lot of places, tend to interrupt the user flow, i.e. pop-ups or auto-play ads. Good use of UX would not want the user to stress out.\n\nResearch: This problem statement is relatable and is common among advertisers who use google web page ads. Lower clicks with higher impressions certainly are bad while with the correct usage of theories it can be efficient.\n\nThe Discovery of ads can be difficult. Hidden in plain sight (goes unnoticed) The number of clicks is not in ratio with the number of impressions. Sometimes the ad can be irrelevant and frustrating.\r\nWith the increase in Ad-block usage, the returns on adverts are lower than ever. People now have control over the ads, and it creates lower opportunities for the advertiser.\n\nTo understand the problem further, I surfed multiple websites of different niches and thus got additional clarity.\n\nInsights\n\n*   The ads stand out but seemingly implies likes it's forced.\n\n*   The ads are too minimalistic and go unnoticed.\n\n*   The highest clicks are generated when the ad is mostly relevant to the topic of interest.\n\n*   Page transition ads can be annoying and certainly, people don't want that.\n\n*   Inline ads are ignored the most.\n\nWhile the bounce rate for a website can be high, the click rate of an ad could be the exact opposite. Graphic designs can be done for it to strike out and gain an eye, but sometimes that even could be annoying for a few. It should match with the experiences of all people who visit a website. Keep in mind that it shouldn't go camouflage nor have a bizarre look.\n\nUser Personas: Nothing really. Just two types of people. Frustrated and Chilled.\n\nThe solution should act as a suggestion for who could potentially try out the product/service mentioned in the ad. Either be it any platform, people should only see a genuine piece of advertising that doesn't take their eye from what they are there for. Ads, on a large scale, in order to be effective can follow being meaningful by creating results that produce empathy within the user. A decent ratio of relevancy and respect is should be maintained\n\nBad ads and their UX result in their ad being blocked. Pop-up ads disrupt the flow of the user. \"Unintrusive yet Noticeable\".\n\nThe ad in order to stand out must not be interfering but should be noticeable. It can look different than the surrounding elements, but should almost be in sync with the website content.\n\nThough there are no proven methods to produce ideal ads, implementing UX and iterative design is a way to go\n"
