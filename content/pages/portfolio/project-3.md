    content: "A social online space. Focused on networking, information, and development.\r\nThese design plans depict the future of Lighthouse’s branding. As a growing product, it focuses on developing a space purely for people’s growth and productivity. Professional portfolios and a networking forum with groups.\r\nLighthouse, as planned, is a professional information site, structured to develop and network one's self.\n\nUser Research: Literature Review, Competitive Analysis\r\nUX Design: Prototyping\r\nDevelopment: Accessible sites\n\nTools Used\r\nFigma\r\nNext.js\r\nReactJS\r\nNode\n\nCompetitive Analysis\r\nWhile doing research to find out the already available platforms for professional people, a few stand out though a few aren't yet popular. Showwcase, Hashnode, Devto, trailhead by salesforce. A lot of these online \"communities\" share a lot in common which makes them less likeable, people don't care. Few succeed in retaining professionals or students making it valuable for them by actually reducing the complexity. It either could be space or time complexity. Stackoverflow is a great example, it passes all the rules thereby making it stand out.\n\nThe word \"community\" and \"networking\" is being thrown out too much, that it almost becomes boring for a person. The whole subject of the project is to retain the people visiting, and keep them engaged within the application. To do that, extensive methods like exclusive branding is planned. Developing a brand where people are curious by themselves is more efficient than insisting people use it to get better.\n"
