    content: "The UX of Sign-Ups and Log-Ins\n\nEver since the rise of interactive applications, the use of authentication has also risen. It is one of the most tedious processes when it comes to using a product. When the authentication process is not driven correctly the chances of users missing out on trying your application reduces. Obviously, it's a big hurdle but with seamless integration with the principles of UX applied, the process can be ideal.\r\nMost platforms yet have gone with the wrong UX choice, the practices though might be user-friendly but inefficient.\n\nSign-Ups and Sign Ins should be also placed at the right place and right time. This is the most important part. Not following user-friendly practices causes bounce off.\n\nThe Design rules at most are basic, yet crucial.\n\nDetails that are required for a user Sign-Up should mostly be basic. Sticking with a one-page transition has proven to be efficient.\r\nIndicating the points required is key, and the order should be based on the importance hierarchy. Passwords and sensitive information should be indicated and advice the user to set uncommon passwords. Errors and overflow can be indicated at the moment. By not indicating the labels or the details, the user is most likely to bounce off. One wouldn't care about coming back to correct a piece of information when the indication is provided after he has completed filling the rest and has proceeded to the final submit.\n\nA lot of applications ask for email-based verification, while one may think that is a smart way to make the process more secure and easy, it actually loosens the interest in the user. Verification is only efficient when there are high stakes.\n\nThe most frustrating situation in all of this process is when the product/service asks you to login/signup before you can see anything else, blocking the content one actually came for. The user doesn't expect that, and after that, the product shouldn't be expecting that user again. Users feel the same with Subscription base messages that appear halfway through.\n\nA few examples of products that follow this process are Brainly, Medium, Times Of India, etc.\n\nThe ones that process the user towards the login page immediately after a sign-up is even worse. Bad UX always leads to drop-off.\n"
